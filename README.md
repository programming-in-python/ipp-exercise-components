# Programming in Python - An Introduction
This repository contains student solutions to the exercise requirements specified in the [Programming in Python - An Introduction - Kanban Board](https://github.com/orgs/programming-in-python/projects/1/views/1).

The Kanban Board provides configuration guidelines and exercises related to the *INFO 5002: Intro to Python for Information Systems* course at Northeastern University in Boston, MA, taught by [Prof. Andy King](https://andyking.me).

While the source code solutions contained herein (under `exercises` primarily) are expected to be implemented per the guidlines specified in the `DEV` modules within [Programming in Python - An Introduction - Kanban Board](https://github.com/orgs/programming-in-python/projects/1/views/1), the Python code (within `exercises`) should be implemented by the student taking the course.

Pre-defined exercise modules and test modules will contain the requisite copyright and usage license. Students may choose to select their own for work they do exclusively themselves.

## References
The exercises and tests in this repository are based on the tasks specified in the [Programming in Python - An Introduction - Kanban Board](https://github.com/orgs/programming-in-python/projects/1/views/1)

For more information on the Programming in Python - An Introduction course, please see the [README.md](https://github.com/programming-in-python/ipp-exercise-tasks).

## Directory Structure
The path structure in this repository is designed to be as simple as possible to align with the 10 lab modules specified in [Programming in Python - An Introduction - Kanban Board](https://github.com/orgs/programming-in-python/projects/1/views/1). The student is welcome to make changes to this structure after the course.

### Exercises
- The `exercises` aims to simply call out a package per lab module - that is, `labmodule01` is a package, yet it may contain multiple modules (or Python files). Later packages may have dependencies on earlier packages as exercises get more complex and OO concepts are applied. That is, modules defined in `labmodule03` may be useful (and used in) modules defined in, for example, `labmodule10`. It is not a goal of this course to require such dependencies, this statement is merely an acknowledgement that they may naturally exist. There are no expectations, however, that the reverse will be the case - that is, `labmodule03` should never contain any module or logic that depends upon a later lab module, such as `labmodule10`.

### A Brief FAQ
- Why the extra `ipp` in the path name?
  - This is to avoid possible confusion with other lib's when importing a solution from an earlier exercise into a later one. For instance, importing the `labmodule03` package requires inclusion of the `pip` package, as shown:
  `import ipp.exercises.labmodule03 as labmodule03`
  - While this may seem to run against the principle of simplicity, it does - IMO - improve clarity.

- What are the `README.md` files for in each `labmodule{#}` path?
  - These documentation files are for the student to complete as part of each lab module exercise. The `README.md` contains a template within the file that should be self-explanatory.

- What about the `README-PROPOSAL.md` in `labmodule10`? What is it for?
  - This is the proposal template for the semester project. Students proposing a particular use case as their `labmodule10` semester project implementation should use this template to describe what they want to do, why it's important, and provide some insights into how they plan to implement the solution.

### Tests
- The `tests` path mimics the exercises path. It contains packages for each lab module, although not all lab modules will have tests. The student may choose to add their own test(s) to correspond with exercise implementations in the exercises path.

  ./common
    ./__init__.py
    ./test_ConfigUtilCustom.py
    ./test_ConfigUtilDefault.py
    ./DummyCredFile.props
